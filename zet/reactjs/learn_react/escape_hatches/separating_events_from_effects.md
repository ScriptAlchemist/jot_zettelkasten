# Separating Events from Effects

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again.
Unlike event handler, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read,
like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during
the last render. Somethings, you also want a mix for both behaviors: an
Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page
will teach you how to do that.

## Choosing between event handler and Effects

First, let's recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.

Imagine you're implementing a chat room component. Your requirements
look like this:

1. Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat
   room.
2. When you click the "Send" button, it should send a message to the
   chat.

Let's say you've already implemented the code for them, but you're not
sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every
time you need to answer this question, consider why the code needs to
run.

## Event handlers run in response to specific interactions

From the user's perspective, sending a message should happen because the
particular "Send" button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if
you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This
is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let
you handle specific interactions like clicks:

```javascript
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  // ...
  function handleClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button> onClick={handleClick}>Send</button>;
    </>
  );
}
```

With an event handler, you can be sure that `sendMessage(message)` will
only run if the user presses the button.

## Effects run whenever synchronization is needed

Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat
room. Where does that code go?

The reason to run this code is not some particular interaction. It
doesn't matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen.
Now that they're looking at it and could interact with it, the component
needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat
room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not
performed any interactions at all, you would still need to connect. This
is why it's an Effect:

```
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active
connection to the currently selected chat server, regardless of the
specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only
opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another
screen and back, your Effect will ensure that the component will remain
synchronized with the currently selected room, and will re-connect
whenever it's necessary.

`chat.js`:

```javascript
export function sendMessage(message) {
  console.log('🔵 You sent: ' + message);
}

export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' +
      serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  function handleSendClick() {
    sentMessage(message);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Reactive values and reactive logic

Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered
"manually", for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other
hand, are "automatic": they run and re-run as often as its' needed to
stay synchronized.

There is more precise ways to think about it.

Props, state, and variables declared inside your component's body are
called `reactive values`. In this example, `serverUrl` is not a reactive
value, but `roomId` and `message` are. They participate in the rendering
data flow:

```javascript
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  // ...
}
```

Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example,
the use may edit the `message` or choose a different `roomId` in a
dropdown. Event handlers and Effects are different in how they respond
to changes:

* Logic inside event handlers is not reactive. It will not run again
  unless the user performs the same interaction (for example, a click)
  again. Event handlers can read reactive values, but they don't "react"
  to their changes.
* Logic inside Effects is reactive. If your Effect reads a reactive
  value, you have to specify it as a dependency. Then, if a re-render
  causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect's logic
  again with the new value.

Let's revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.

## Logic inside event handlers is not reactive

Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?

```javascript
// ...
setMessage(message);
// ...
```

From the user's perspective, a change to the `message` does not mean
that they want to send a message. It only means that the user is typing.
In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive.
It should not run again only because the reactive value has changed.
That's why you placed this logic in the event handler:

```javascript
function handleSendClick() {
  sendMessage(message);
}
```

Event handlers aren't reactive, so `sendMessage(message)` will only run
when the user clicks the send button.

## Logic inside Effects is reactive

Now let's return to these lines:

```javascript
// ...
const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
connection.connect();
// ...
```
From the user's perspective, a change to the `roomId` does mean that
they want to connect to a different room. In other words, the logic for
connecting to the room should be reactive. You want these lines of code
to "keep up" with the reactive value, and to run again if that value is
different. That's why you put logic inside an Effect:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
  connection.connect();
  return () => {
    connection.disconnect();
  };
}. [roomId]);
```

Effects are reactive, so `createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)` and
`connection.connect()` will run for every distinct value of `roomId`.
Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently
selected room.

## Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects

Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with
non-reactive logic.

For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user
connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from
the props so that you can show the notification to the correct color:

```javascript
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

However, `theme` is a reactive value (it can change as a result of
re-rendering), and every reactive value read by an Effect must be
declared as its dependency. So now you have to specify `theme` as a
dependency of your Effect:

```javascript
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
    // ...
```

Play with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this
user experience:

`notification.js`:

```javascript
import Toastify from 'toastify-js';
import 'toastify-js/src/toastify.css';

export function showNotification(message, theme) {
  Toastify({
    text: message,
    duration: 2000,
    gravity: 'top',
    position: 'right',
    style: {
      background: theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white',
      color: theme === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'black',
    },
  }).showToast();
}
```

`chat.js`:

```javascript
import function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  let connectedCallback;
  let timeout;
  return {
    connect() {
      timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        if (connectedCallback) {
          connectedCallback();
        }
      }, 100);
    },
    on(event, callback) {
      if (connectedCallback) {
        throw Error('Cannot add the handler twice.');
      }
      if (event !== 'connected') {
        throw Error('Only "connected" event is supported.');
      }
      connectedCallback = callback;
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    }
  };
}
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notification.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234':

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnectio(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, theme]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);
  return (
      <>
        <label>
          Choose the chat room:{' '}
          <select
            value={roomId}
            onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
          >
            <option value="general">general</option>
            <option value="travel">travel</option>
            <option value="music">music</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={isDark}
            onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
          />
          Use Dark Theme
        </label>
        <hr />
        <ChatRoom
          roomId={roomId}
          theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}
        />
      </>
  );
}
```

When the `roomId` changes, the chat re-connects as you would expect. But
since `theme` is also a dependency, that chat also re-connects every
time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That's not great!

In other words, you don't want this line to be reactive, even though it
is inside an Effect (which is reactive):

```javascript
// ...
showNotification('Connected!', theme);
// ...
```

You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive
Effect around it.

## Declaring an Effect Event

> #### Under construction
>
> This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been added
> to react, so you can't use it yet.

Use a special Hook called `useEffectEvent` to extract this non-reactive
logic out of your Effect:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });
  // ...
```

Here, `onConnected` is called an Effect Event. It's a part of your
Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic
inside it is not reactive, and it always "sees' the latest values of
your props and state.

Now you can call the `onConnected` Effect Event from inside your Effect:

```javascript
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This solves the problem. Note that you had to remove `onConnected` from
the list on your Effect's dependencies. Effect Events are not reactive
and must be omitted from dependencies. The linter will error if you
include them.

Verify that the new behavior works as you would expect:

`chat.js`:

```javascript
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  let connectedCallback;
  let timeout;
  return {
    connect() {
      timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        if (connectedCallback) {
          connectedCallback();
        }
      }, 100);
    },
    on(event, callback) {
      if (connectedCallback) {
        throw Error('Cannot add the handler twice.');
      }
      if (event !== 'connected') {
        throw Error('Only "connected" event is supported.');
      }
      connectedCallback = callback;
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearTimout(timeout);
    }
  };
}
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { experimental_useEffectEvent as UseEffectEvent } from react'
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notification.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234':

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnectio(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, theme]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);
  return (
      <>
        <label>
          Choose the chat room:{' '}
          <select
            value={roomId}
            onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
          >
            <option value="general">general</option>
            <option value="travel">travel</option>
            <option value="music">music</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={isDark}
            onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
          />
          Use Dark Theme
        </label>
        <hr />
        <ChatRoom
          roomId={roomId}
          theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}
        />
      </>
  );
}
```

You can thing of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers.
The main difference is that event handlers run in response to a user
interactions, whereas Effect Events are trigger by you from Effects.
Effect Events let you "break the chain" between the reactivity of
Effects and some code that should be not reactive.

## Reading latest props and state with Effect Events

> #### Under Construction
>
> This section describes and experimental API that has not yet been added
to React, so you can't use it yet.

Effect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to
suppress the dependency linter.

For example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:

```javascript
function Page() {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

Later, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your `Page` component
receives a `url` prop with the current path. You want to pass the `url`
as a part of your `logVisit` call, but the dependency linter complains:

```javascript
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, []); // 🛑 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'
  // ...
}
```

Think about what you want the code to do. You want to log a separate
visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In
order words, this `logVisit` call should be reactive with respect to the
`url`. This is why, in this case, it makes sens to follow the dependency
linter, and add `url` as a dependency:

```javascript
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ..
}
```

Now let's say you want to include the number of items in the shopping
cart together with every page visit:

```javascript
function Page({ url }) {
  const { tems } useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
  }, [url]); // 🛑 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency:
  numbersOfItems
  // ...
}
```

You used `numberOfItems` inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to
add it as a dependency. However, you don't want the `logVisit` call to
be reactive with respect to `numberOfItems`. If the user puts something
into the shopping cart, and the `numberOfItems` changes, this does not
mean that the user visited the page again. In other words, visiting the
page feels similar to an event. You want to be very precise about when
you say it's happened.

Split the code into two parts:

```javascript
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Here, `onVisit` is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn't reactive.
This is why you can use `numberOfItems` (or any other reactive value!)
without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute
on changes.

On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the
Effect uses the `url` prop, so the Effect will re-run after every
re-render with a different `url`. This, in turn will call the `onVisit`
Effect Event.

As a result, you will call `logVisit` for every change to the `url`, and
always ready the latest `numberOfItems`. However, if `numberOfItems`
changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.

> #### Note
> You might be wondering if you could call `onVisit()` with no
arguments, an dread the `url` inside it:

```javascript
const onVisit = useEffectEvent(() => {
  logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
});

useEffect(() => {
  onVisit();
}, [url]);
```

> This would work, but it's better to pass this `url` to the Effect
> Event explicitly. By passing `url` as an argument to your Effect Event,
> you are saying that visiting a page with a different `url` constitutes a
> separate "event" from the user's perspective. The `visitUrl` is a part
> of the "event" that happened:

```javascript
const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
  logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
});

useEffect(() => {
  onVisit(url);
}, [url]);
```

> Since your Effect Event explicitly "asks" for the `visitedUrl`, now
you can't accidentally remove `url` from the Effect's dependencies. If
you remove the `url` dependency (causing distinct page visits to be
counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want `onVisit`
to be reactive with regards to the `url`, to instead of reading the
`url` inside (where it wouldn't be reactive), you pass it from your
Effect.
