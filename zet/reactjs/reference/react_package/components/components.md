# Built-in React Components

React exposes a few built-in components that you can use in your JSX.

---

## Built-in components

* `<Fragment>`, alternatively written as `<>,,,</>`, lets you group
  multiple JSX node together.
* `<Profiler>` lets you measure rendering performance of a React tree
  programmatically.
* `<Suspense>` lets you display a fallback while the child components
  are loading.
* `<StrictMode>` enables extra development-only checks that help you
  find bugs early.

## Your own components

You can also define your components as JavaScript functions.
