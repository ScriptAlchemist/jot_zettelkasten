# Wasmtime Reaches 1.0: Fast, Safe and Production Ready!

> Notes from [Lin Clark](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-1-0-fast-safe-and-production-ready)

As of today, the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime is now at 1.0! this means
that all of us in the Bytecode Alliance agree that it is fully ready to
use in production.

In truth, we could have called Wasmtime production-ready [more than a
year
ago.](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/14#issuecomment-915589031)
But we didn't want to release just any WebAssembly engine. We wanted to
have a super fast and super safe WebAssembly engine. We wanted to feel
really confident with we recommend that people choose Wasmtime.

So to make sure it's production ready for all of you, a number of us in
the Bytecode Alliance have been running Wasmtime in production ourselves
for the past year. And Wasmtime has been doing great in these production
environments, providing a stable platform while also giving us security
and speed wins.

Here are some of our experiences with the new, improved Wasmtime:

* **Shopify -- 14 months in production**
  Shopify switched to Wasmtime for another WebAssembly engine in July
  2021. With the switch, Shopify saw an `average execution performace
        improvements of ~50%.`
