## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* Define APIs and their impacts
* Acknowledge the digital feedback loop
* Summarize the business benefits of APIs
* Identify the API value in real life through Amazon and Disney case
  study.

## Key Points

Some of the business benefits that will be discussed (including the
separation of fact from fiction) include:

* New revenue
* Reach and retention
* Faster partnerships
* Mobile and omnichannel
* Interaction analytics
* Outsourced innovation
* Self-service integration
* Organizational agility

## Introduction to APIs

Application Programming interface. A building block that work behind the
scenes to connect different applications and systems so they can share
information

* Online Payment
* Social media account

Apis are entry points into your organizations' capabilities that can be
accessed through different channels such as browsers, mobile apps,
social networks, and IoT devices.

Traditionally interaction happening through the browser. Today there is
a growing need to send and receive data.

Some examples of API are liking things on Twitter without logging in.
Developers need to understand the interface to write code.

It helps build communities around the developers.

It's now what they are, but what they enable.

APIs are digital enablers to extend your data.

You can expose account queries or shipping queries.

We can use it to expand reach and also pull data to learn about the
people using the APIs that you build.

* New revenue
* Reach and retention
* Faster partnerships
* Mobile and omnichannel
* Interaction Analysis
* Outsourced Innovation
* Self-service Integration
* Organizational Agility

### New Revenus

* `Google Maps`: is a good examples of this. Creating the biggest map
service.

* `Twillio`: Services that allow the mobile phone service. Like text
  messages and voice messages.

### Reach and Retention

APIs allow content and service providers to reach captive audiences
where they spend their time.

* One good example of this `NPR` to allow their content to show up
everywhere on the web.

* `Ebay`: products embedded all over because their api is accessible all
  over the web. Getting the message and content out there.

### Faster Partnerships

Well documented, usable APIs allow partners to onboard themselves in
record time

* `Kayak`: and the green button alliance. They used APIs to find air,
  car, and hotel providers. They generate revenue with ads and vendors
  affiliate programs.

### Mobile and Omnichannel

Offering services through APIs is the best way to provide a consistent
digital experience across all channels

* `American Eagle`: Quick to jump into using the information they could
  pull from APIs.
* `Capital One`: Getting the use of their banking through APIs.

### Interaction Analysis

Having customers and partners access services through APIs creates a
digital feedback loop, allowing real-time analysis of user behavior

* `Mastercard`: They were giving data in a file at first. The API based
  approach is a faster option. Mastercard can also control access to the
  data. They can tune the APIs more the get better data.

### Outsourced Innovation

Publishing a public API can lead to unanticipated innovation from third
party developers

* `Netflix`: third party developers build applications on platforms like
  Xbox, playstation and more. Eventually Netflix restricted access to
  regain control.

### Self-Service Integration

An API-enabled enterprise allows more rapid integration of disparate
business capabilities and assembly of new products.

* `Amazon`: The amazon success story and how they paved they way for the
  self service platform.

### Organization Agility

Adoption of an "API first" engineering philosophy along with a
microservice architecture maximizes delivery speed, system stability and
scalability.

* `Netflix`
* `HBC Digital`
* `Soundclound`
