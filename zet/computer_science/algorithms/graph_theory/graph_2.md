# Common Graph Theory Problems

For the upcoming problems ask yourself:

* Is the graph directed or undirected?
* Are the edges of the graph weighted?
* Is the graph I will encounter likely to be sparse or dense with edges?
* Should I use an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, an edge list or other structure to represent the graph efficiently?

### Shortest Path Problem

Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path of edges from node `A` to node `B`.
