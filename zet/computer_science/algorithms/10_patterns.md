# Coding Patterns For Interviews

* If the given input is a `sorted array` or a list, we will either be
  using `Binary Search` or the `Two Pointers` strategy.
* If we are dealing with `top/maximun/minimum/closet` `K` element among
  `n` element, we we be using a `Heap`.
* If we need or try all `combinations (or permutations)` of the input, we can either use `Backtracking` or `Breadth First Search`.
