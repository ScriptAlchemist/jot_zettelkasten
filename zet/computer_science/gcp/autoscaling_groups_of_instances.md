# Auto-scaling groups of instances

Managed instance groups (MIGs) offer auto-scaling capabilities that let
you automatically add or delete virtual machine (VM) instances from MIG
based on increases or decreases in load. Auto-scaling helps your apps
gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduce costs when the need
for resources is lower. You define the auto-scaling policy and the
auto-scaler performs automatic scaling based on the measured load and the
options you configure.

Auto-scaling works by adding more VMs to your MIG when there is more
load (scaling out), and deleting VMs when the need for VMs is lowered
(scaling in).
