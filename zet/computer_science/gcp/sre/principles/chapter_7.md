Beside black art, there is only automation and mechanization.

For SRE, automation is a force multiplier, not a panacea. Of course,
just **multiplying** force does not naturally change the accuracy of
where that force is applied: doing automation thoughtlessly can create as
many problems as it solves. Therefore, while we believe that
software-based automation is superior to manual operation in most
circumstances, better than either option is a higher-level system design
requiring neither of them-an **autonomous** system. Of to put it another
way, the value of automation comes from both what it does and its
judicious application. We'll discuss both the value of automation and
how our attitude has evolved over time.
