The React framework for production. But what does this mean?

Next offers a lot of features to make building full stack frameworks for
ReactJS.

## Isn't React already a framework?

Yes it is, but it's a library. It is focused on components, states and
props. This does not have everything 

## What makes Next different?

NextJS solves common problems and makes building react apps easier.

This allows you to start immediately. You still write React code, you
still build React components and use React features (props, state,
context, ...). NextJS just enhances your React apps and adds more
features. Lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help you solve
common problems and clear guidance on how to use those features. There
are certain problems which you will need to solve for almost all
production-ready React apps:NextJS solves those for you.
